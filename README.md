# Clock App ⏰

A beautifully designed **Flutter Clock App** that combines simplicity with custom logic. This app features:
- A fully functional **Analog Clock** with hands (second, minute, and hour) crafted entirely from scratch.
- A **Stopwatch** to track time with precision.

---

## Features ✨

- **Analog Clock**:
    - Custom logic implemented to calculate and display the second, minute, and hour hands.
    - Smooth and precise movement of hands based on real-time updates.
    - Designed to replicate a traditional analog clock with fluid animations and clean visuals.

- **Stopwatch**:
    - Easy-to-use interface to start, pause, and reset the stopwatch.
    - Displays elapsed time in seconds, minutes, and hours.

## How It Works 💡

### Analog Clock
The analog clock is powered by **custom logic**:
- **Second Hand**: Rotates 6° per second (360° ÷ 60 seconds).
- **Minute Hand**: Rotates 6° per minute (360° ÷ 60 minutes).
- **Hour Hand**: Rotates 30° per hour (360° ÷ 12 hours), with an additional small increment every minute for precision.

Each hand's angle is calculated in real time using the **DateTime** class and custom algorithms to ensure smooth and accurate movement.
